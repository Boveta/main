# Boveta Overview

Boveta is an automatic house valuator. Given an address and a house size Boveta will automatically estimate the value of the property. The idea is to give people the power back when buying or selling property and also cater to peoples curiosity.

The solution is built in ASP.Net and developed in Visual Studio. Database content not included in GitHub commit. Please find a suitable API or database from a home-listing service to populate it.

Future plans also involves rent estimators to help people rent and rent out housing. Predictive modeling has also been suggested to provide insight on how the value of a property is expected to change over time. This would provide house buyers with additional insights before buying their property.
